Hello! This is my tanks game! (I can't come up with a name so it's just "tanks-game" for now)

It's heavily inspired by the old Wii Tanks game.

To control the tank, use these commands:

    W -> Increase the forward speed of the tank
    S -> Increase the backwards speed of the tank
    A -> Rotates the tank leftward (Doesn't require the tank to be moving either forward or backward)
    D -> Rotates the tank rightward (Doesn't require the tank to be moving either forward or backward)

Speed is capped for both going forward and backward but you can go a little faster by going forward than
backwards.

To control the cannon/turret, use these commands:

    Mouse -> The turret will face and fire towards the mouse.
    Left Click -> Tank will fire a "pellet".

I've created pseudo-particles for special effects like when the cannon/turret is fired, the bullet gets 
reflected off a wall, and the bullet gets destroyed (It will only bounce once; after that, it will just 
poof on the next hit).

The game is fully "playable" but I'm in the process of making it more interesting by making a better map 
and better interactions with a such map.

For now, when tanks die, the follow normal physics rules which I think makes it look pretty cool. 

Also, respawning is a capability but is very boring. To respawn, just click the little plus at the
top-left corner or by tapping the letter "R" on your keyboard.

Right now, collisions with "walls" is pretty terrible for the bouncing bullets because I use the law
of reflection to make a psuedo-bouncing-bullet so I'll either remake the bouncing abilities for the
bullets or just make little boxes made of these "panels" that the bullets can bounce off to make it
look better and make sense.

Currently, here's the checklist for the future:

    - Create a good-looking, fully-functioning, and player-interactable map.
    
    - Create an easy to navigate and use UI so you can join specific games with your friends.

    - Polish up any bugs or graphical issues.

    - Publish the game!

This probably won't end up happening but I thought of adding planes, helicopters, and people (That you will
be controlling and you can hop into one of the previously listed vehicles).
