# Tanks
A simple tanks game inspired by Wii Tanks. 

(This game is also visible on my website: [ikd09.github.io](ikd09.gihub.io))

This game is a multiplayer game made with the Ambient Game Engine. 

To control the tank, use the following controls:

  W -> Speed up the tank.
  S -> Slow down the tank (if you push it far enough, it will reverse).
  A/D -> Rotate the tank left and right for the controls (A/D respectively).
  Left Mouse Button -> Fire a bullet going toward the mouse pointer.

Some of the cool features I added to make the game more similar to WiiTanks:

  - Tanks will have treads placed behind them.
  - Bullet will bounce (but occasionally misfire and not).
  - A kill to death title (This isn't in WiiTanks but I think it's cool).

This game is multiplayer right off the bat. To use the multiplayer features easiest,
